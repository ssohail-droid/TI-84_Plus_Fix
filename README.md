## Step 3a: Soldering Tips

⚠️ **Warning:** Soldering irons get very hot. Handle with care.  

1. Set your soldering iron to **350°C (662°F)**.  
2. Apply **flux** to the copper pads before soldering.  
3. Place the iron tip on the pad for **about 4 seconds**.  
4. Deposit solder onto the pad while the iron is in place.  
5. Remove the iron and let the solder **cool naturally**.  

**Tips:**  
- Avoid touching the tip or molten solder.  
- Work in a well-ventilated area.  
- Do not overheat the pads; this can damage the board.
